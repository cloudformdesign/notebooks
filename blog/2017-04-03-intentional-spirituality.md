This is a rough draft for a new secular religion. A secular religion is a
religion that does not have reliance on myth but rather seeks to explore
spiritual experience to aid in the well being of individuals and community.

# Intentional Spirituality
Intentional Spirituality is the recognition that there is such a thing as
spiritual experience, that spiritual experience is a powerful and useful part of
the human experience, and that spiritual experience need not be related to any
kind of unverifiable belief. Rather, spiritual experience is something which can
be learned and experienced intentionally. Our default stance is to reject all
previous religions, traditions, rituals and spiritual paths until specific
practices can be deemed valuable. We reserve the right to modify and experiment
with any such "borrowed" practice to make them our own.

The word "spiritual" is chosen because of a lack of a better one and to
explicitly co-opt the claims of religions based on myth. Yes, spiritual
experience is real. No, spiritual experience has nothing to do with any
particular myth. To help demonstrate what spiritual experience can mean, here is
a story:

> A man walks alone in the woods, being aware of his breath while seeing the
> sunlight filter through the branches in the trees. He is suddenly aware of the
> trees breathing in the carbon dioxide which he exhales and returning oxygen to
> him. In a moment, he feels the symbiotic relationship go deeper -- the trees
> are absorbing his negative energies of anxiety and anger and converting them
> into acceptance and empathy. With each breath he feels a sense of powerful
> connection with the living organism around him, and his sense of connection
> expands outwords. In his mind's eye, he sees the dependencies of all life and
> is suddenly thrilled to be a tiny speck within it.

One does not have to believe that there is any kind of spirit, energy fields or
other woo-woo to feel this kind of interconnectedness with nature. One does not
even have to believe that trees have any psychic power to absorb negative
energy in order to have one's negative energy absorbed. The mind alone can do
all of these things, but often requires *narative* to do the heavy lifting of
having spiritual experience.

Skeptics have to understand that although the tenets of religion do not point
to anything real, the *experiences* that religious people feel *is* real. People
who believe in contradictory myths all have similar spiritual experiences.
In addition, spiritual experience is among the most profound that humans can
have and has the power to change our lives in important and useful ways.
Religions demonstrate its power by using it to blind and control their
adherents. We seek to use spiritual experience to explore what it means to be
human and find the full limits of human well being.

The following are our primary goals:
- **Intellectual Honesty and Skepticism**: we intend to hold intellectual
  honesty as our core value over all others. Any claim shall be held up to a
  high standard of either philosophical rigor, physical evidence or open
  experimentation (meaning we are playing with it and are fully willing to throw
  it away when we find something more useful).
- **Mindfulness**: we seek a clear mind to provide a basis for a spiritual life
  to be fully lived and experienced.
- **Connection**: we seek to enhance our feeling of connection with all levels.
  From our connectedness with our own body, to others, to community, and from
  ourselves to all other life. We believe that such connection is the key to
  living a spiritual and ethical life.
- **Ritual and Community**: we seek to create philosophy, rituals, practices and
  community that are more fulfilling and useful to the human experience than
  mythical religions can provide. We intend to fulfill the gap in human
  experience which secular culture lacks by providing rituals such as:
  - **Coming of age**: celebrating the stages in an individual's life. For
    example: birth, childhood independence, adolescence, adulthood, union,
    separation and death
  - **Regular Meetings**: a time to socialize, reflect, sing, dance, eat and
    perform the miriad of other necessary human functions that evolved talking
    monkies like ourselves need in order to feel fulfilled.
  - **Events**: social, family, charity and emotional support and events

The following are NOT our goals:
- **Philosophical and Ritual Stability**: this document represents the first
  edition of Intentional Spirituality, and we hope it is not the last. We intend
  to continue to apply the goal of skepticism to our own practices. Any practice
  or ritual that becomes a part of this philosophy may be discarded for more
  effective ones, in the same way as pieces of other traditions are discarded.
  Our beliefs are not special and are subject to the same skepticism as any
  other. Our hope is that over time we will find philosophical bedrock that can
  be useful for many generations, but we hold no qualms about how future
  generations use our discoveries.
- **Inclusion of Other Philosophies**: We are not interested in including other
  philosophies, traditions, rituals or spiritual paths that cannot withstand
  rigorous skepticism. If it does not have a scientific or philosophical basis,
  then it is not welcome. Any idea which seeks inclusion will undergo a rigorous
  trial period where it will be placed under intense skepticism and may be
  modified tremendously if it is included at all. If it cannot prove it's worth
  it will be rejected. Some things, especially rituals, are harder to "prove"
  and thus will be continuously evaluated and evolved. However, we will always
  seek scientific consensus wherever possible.

# Initial Philosophical Charter
We do not hold the belief in any myth as necessary to a spiritual life and we
intend to prove this fact by living a spiritual life without such beliefs. We
see no evidence of any angel, demon, diety, heaven, hell, soul, ghost or other
myths and see no reason why spiritual experience has to be tied to any of them.

## Determinism
We believe in determinism, which means we believe that we are a product of our
genetics, experiences and past decisions. Determinism is a self evident from
living in a physical universe, since by definition a physical universe means
that everything is *determined by physics* (including the neurons that fire in
your brain, which is where you make your decisions). In fact, it is self evident
regardless. However, that is a more in-depth proof that we will not go into
here.

Determinism is extremely important for finding fulfillment and living an
ethical life. However, many people confuse determinism with fatalism.
To be determined means that you could not have changed the past -- what happened
was inevitable. However because you are determined, the future will be based on
the habits and experiences you form *now*. By contrast, fatalism is the belief
that the future cannot be changed regardless of the decisions you make today.

Accepting that you are determined allows you to see your future more clearly.
Your future behavior will be determined by the decisions you make now. For
instance, if you want to be a better person then you should adopt habits that
improve your patience, empathy and mindfulness. Believing that you are NOT
determined (i.e. that you have free will) puts you in an endless cycle of blame,
where each time you are "not a good person" is because of some personal moral
failing -- not because of past habits and inclinations that were outside your
control.

Belief in determinism gives us philosophical bedrock to create rituals for
accepting guilt and shame and finding habits to improve. In addition, ritual
should be created that can help individuals practice at making mistakes and
learn *before* they harm others.

## Moral Realism
We believe in moral realism, where ethics is determined by the well being of
concious creatures. "Well being" is a broad definition encompassing not just
pleasure but also emotional stability, health, wisdom, connectedness and many
other factors. It is a similar concept to "health", which is difficult to define
but easy to understand. We wish for ethics to be determined as scientifically as
possible, but accept that such a goal is difficult to (currently) obtain in
practice. We wish to help in the effort to enhance the science of ethics.

We reject the form of moral realism practiced by many world religions, where
morality can only be derived from some kind of "revealed truth" from a mythical
entity.

We do not accept moral relativism, where culture or tradition determine what is
moral regardless of the suffering such practices create.
