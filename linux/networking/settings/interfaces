#   Wireless Configuration
# This configuration uses wpa_supplicant. wpa_supplicant allows you to "roam", 
# i.e. automatically connect to a wireless network if it is available.
# Line by line summary:
#   - wlan0 auto-connects at boot
#   - wlan0 can be hotplugged, i.e. removed and plugged back in
#   - enable manual configuration so that wpa_supplicant can
#       configure the wifi network
#   - use wpa-roam (not wpa-config) so that roaming is enabled
#       Edit wpa_supplicant.conf to add networks to connect to
#   - use the "home_static" id_str from wpa_supplicant.conf and make
#       it "static" (instead of dhcp). See wpa_supplicant.conf
#   - static address = 192.168.0.64  Set the address based on your
#       network and preferences. You can scan used addresses with
#       `sudo nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24` (you must use your own network ip)
#   - netmask for ip addresses. You can use `ifconfig -a` on a computer
#       connected with DHCP where Mask==netmask
#   - gateway for ip addresses. Use `route -n | grep "UG\|Gateway"` to get it
#   - dns nameservers for static ip. These are used to do ip address
#       lookups. 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are google's dns servers
