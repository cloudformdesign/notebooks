# basic commands
- `mv` - move file or folder
- `cp` - copy file. Use `-r` for recursive copy
- `dd` - copies from source to destination, block by block,
    without regard to filesystem types or operating systems
- `du -sh <folder>`: find size of folder in human readable way

# putting a large file on a system
Fill up the `/` directory. Let's break this command down:

export oversize=.*;   # we are declaring oversize until the ";"

$[   # linux variable syntax

# get the size of /var/log -> only the second column -> delete the first row -> remove the "G"
( $(df -h /var/log | awk '{print $2}' | sed 1d | sed 's/G//') 

# add 2 to the value then convert to M (instead of G). This will over-fill the drive by at least 2 extra GB
+ 2) * 1024]; 

# create a random password from urandom and remove newlines
export pass=.*; 
export pass=${pass//$'\n'/};

# use open ssl to generate random data from the password (faster than urandom directly)
dd if=<(openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:$pass -nosalt < /dev/zero) 

# put it in bogusly_big_file
bs=1M count=$oversize iflag=fullblock | sudo tee /bogusly_big_file > /dev/null"

```
"export oversize=$[ ( $(df -h /var/log | awk '{print $2}' | sed 1d | sed 's/G//') + 2) * 1024]; export pass=\"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64)\"; export pass=${pass//$'\n'/}; dd if=<(openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:$pass -nosalt < /dev/zero) bs=1M count=$oversize iflag=fullblock | sudo tee /bogusly_big_file > /dev/null"
```
