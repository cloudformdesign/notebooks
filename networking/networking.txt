# Scanning
- `sudo nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24` - scans the network for matching ip addresses

# wpa_supplicant

## configuring
open `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf' and make it look like settings/wpa_supplicant.conf
open `/etc/network/interfaces' and make it look like `settings/interfaces`

Notes:
- You may need to install `resolvconf`
    - on raspberry pi you don't seem to need to
- In ubuntu, the network manager will destroy resolv.conf
