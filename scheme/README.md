This is the best tutorial I could find:
https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs251/s20/topics/racket.html

I really liked this quote:

> Functional languages are built around the evaluation of expressions and the
> application of functions for their results, rather than the execution of
> sequences of commands for their effects on mutable stored data. In some sense,
> functional languages are a little closer to expressing what to compute, while
> imperative  languages are closer to expressing how to compute it.
>
> **Functional languages are closer to math; imperative languages are closer to
> the model presented by most modern computer hardware systems.**

I bolded the final part because I think it better describes what I'm trying to
do, and why I likely won't be using Racket.
