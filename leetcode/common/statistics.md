# Expected Value
- running average
- `E[values] = SUM[values] / NUM[values]`
- `E[X] = x1*p1 + x2*p2 + ... + x_k*p_k

# Standard Deviation
Defines the amount of variation (dispertion) in a sample.
It is just the square root of variance

- The average of each value minus the expected value.
- E(X-u)

# Variance
- Also called:
  - mean of square minus square of mean
  - sigma-squared
  - stddev squared
- E[(X-u)^2]
- E[X^2] - E[X]^2

- variance is always >= 0
