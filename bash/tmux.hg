# Tmux stuff

Tmux has sessions, windows, and panes.

- sessions are completely distinct tmux sessions.
- windows are like "tabs" in sessions, before tabs were cool
- panes split windows up


# useful commands
See .tmux.conf and the tmux section of .alias

Also:
- breaking panes into their own window: `break-pane -t :`
