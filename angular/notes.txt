# Dependency injection
- needed dependencies are listed in the `constructor` method
- `providers` provides the list of dependencies to inject to a component or module
- dependencies are injected into the parent and all children Injectables (including components)
- in order to have your dependencies injected, you must mark it with `@Injectable` or `@Component`, etc
- proivders technically provide the concrete-runtime version of a dependency value. Typically these
    are just classes, and if their dependencies are listed and are Injectable then the dependencies
    will just be automatically injected.
    The typical `providers` list is shorthand for: `[{ provide: Logger, useClass: Logger }]`
