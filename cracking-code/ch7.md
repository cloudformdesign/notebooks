# PG 58 CH7: Object Oriented Design

## 7.1
> Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards
> Explain how you would sub class it to implement particular card games.


There would obviously be the base classes:

```
class Deck(object):
    """
    A deck of cards.

    treated as a FIFO buffer.
    """

    def __init__(self, cards: List[Card]):
        self.cards = cards

    def shuffle(self):
        """Shuffle the deck randomly."""
        pass

    def draw(self, num=1):
        """Draw a the number of cards from the top of the deck.

        The cards are removed from the deck.
        """
        pass

    def random(self, num=1):
        """Get a random set of cards.

        The cards are removed from the deck.
        """

    def insert(self, cards: List[Card], index=0):
        """Insert a list of cards into the deck."""

    def extend(self, cards: List[Card]):
        """Add cards to the top of the deck.
        """


class Card(object):
    def __init__(self, suite: CardSuite, value: CardValue):
        self.suite = suite
        self.value = value

    def __eq__(self, other: Card):
        return self.suite == other.suite and self.value == other.value

    def __gt__(self, other: Card):
        """... all comparison operators."""


class CardSuite(enum.Enum):
    heart = "heart"
    diamond = "diamond"
    club = "club"
    spade = "spade"

    def __gt__(self, other: Suite):
        """... all comparison operators."""


class CardValue(enum.Enum):
    one = 1
    two = 2
    ...
    nine = 9
    ten = 10
    jack = 11
    queen = 12
    king = 13
    joker = 100

    def __gt__(self, other: CardValue):
        """... all comparison operators."""
```

Particular card games could subclass `Deck` or even `Card` to help them implement
their logic.

```
class PokerDeck(Deck):
    def deal_poker_hand(self) -> PokerHand:
        """Remove 5 cards from the deck, putting them in the poker hand."""

    def deal_one(self, hands: List[PokerHand]):
        """Insert a card into each hand, being sure to throw away the first card."""


class PokerHand(object):
    def __init__(self, cards: Set[Card]):
        self.cards = cards

        # suites+values make it easy to determine
        # 4-of-a-kind, flush, etc.
        self.suites = {}
        for c in cards:
            if c.suite not in self.suites:
                self.suites[c] = 0
            self.suites[c] += 1

        self.values = {}
        # ... same as suites

    def insert(self, card: Card):
        """Insert a card into the hand."""

    def max_4ofakind(self) -> Option[Card]:
        """If this is "4 of a kind" return the highest card.

        Else return None.
        """

    def max_2ofakind(self) -> Option[Card]:
        """etc..."""

    def __gt__(self, other: PokerHand):
        """... all comparison operators."""
```


# 7.2
> Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: fresher,

```

class CallCenter(object):
    def __init__(self, freshers: List[Fresher], tech_lead, prod_man):
        self.freshers = freshers
        self.tech_lead = tech_lead
        self.prod_man = prod_man

    def getCallHandler(self) -> Employee:
        if self.get_fresher_handler():
            return
        if self.tech_lead.attempt_call():
            return
        if self.prod_man.attemp_call():
            return
        raise CallNotHandled()

    def get_fresher_handle(self):
        for fresher in self.freshers:
            if fresher.attempt_call():
                return True

class Employee(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def attempt_call(self):
        """Attempt to handle the call.

        If the call is being handled return True, else False.
        """
        got_lock = self.lock.acquire(block=False)
        if not got_lock:
            return False  # call is not being handled
        threading.spawn(target=self._handle_call)
        return True

    def _handle_call(self):
        handle_call()
        self.lock.release()


```

## Conclusion
I got way too into the weed here. I should have focused on the objects themselves
and how to design them. I tried to come up with a multihreaded solution without
really thinking about:
- What does the `Call` object look like?
- Should each kind of employee have an object? What do they look like?
- etc...

Clearly a conversation would have _helped_ me, but it is good to know the general direction
that is inteded to go.


# 7.3
> Design a musical juke box using object oriented principles

It is a musical juke box, what does it do?
- Accepts payment
- Plays music
- Handles a bunch of _different CD's_, each of which have different tracks.
- Accepts customer's choice in music which gets appended to the queue.
  - The customer can choose a sequence _any tracks_ (regardless of CD's)
  - Any customer can always "add next track" to the queue.
