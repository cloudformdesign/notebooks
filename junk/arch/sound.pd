Hey guys, I can't seem to get my sound card working

...
After looking, it seems the problem may have been the command

$ speaker-test -c 2

When I run
$ speaker-test -c 2 -t wav -D plughw:PCH
or
speaker-test -c 8 -t wav -D default:PCH

Then I get output from the speakers (front left then front right)

However, I still can't seem to get sound working on youtube.


I have been trying to do the guide here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture , but haven't had much sucesses except getting the beep to work.

# installed alsa-utils and tried that stuff
```
 ~  amixer sset Master 
unmuteamixer: Unable to find simple control 'Master',0
```

`alsamixer` gives me my HDMI ports, which are unmuted and card 2 is my intel motherboard sound card, which I unmuted.

```
$ speaker-test -c 2
speaker-test 1.0.29
Playback device is default
Stream parameters are 48000Hz, S16_LE, 2 channels
Using 16 octaves of pink noise
ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:1024:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave

$ aplay -L | grep :CARD

```

looks like my card is "default"

```
$ speaker-test -D default -c 8
